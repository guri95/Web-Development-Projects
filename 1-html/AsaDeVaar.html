		<h1><em>ASA DI WAR</em></h1>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Asa Di War</strong> is a collection of 24 pauris or stanzas written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak">Guru Nanak Dev ji</a>
			(Sri Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 462 to Ang 475).Some people argue that the founder of Sikhism,
			Guru Nanak Dev ji wrote the first 9 together on one occasion and later wrote 15 more stanzas
			on a different occasion but Professor Sahib Singh and some of the foremost Sikh scholars
			believe that the whole Var was written at the same place as the Var itself proceeds 
			in a definite uniformity. The whole Var was compiled by the 5th Guru, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Arjan">Guru Arjan Dev ji</a>> in 1604 AD.
			When Guru Arjan Dev ji was compiling the Holy Granth, he added a few Sloks of Guru Nanak dev ji
			and in some cases <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Angad">Guru Angad Dev ji</a>, the second Guru of the Sikhs. These Sloks are tied together
			in a way that they relate to the same theme as highlighted in the pauri. In its present form,
			the Asa Di Var contains a few more shabads recited by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Ram_Das">Guru Ram Das ji</a>, the fourth Sikh Guru. </p>

			<p><strong>Structure and Meaning:</strong><br> 
			There are lines alluding to the moral decay that had set in, and showing how cant, hypocrisy and superstition passed under the name of religion and how people had begun aping the dress and language of their foreign masters. The Var opens with the praise of the Guru, the spiritual preceptor, who brings light into the world:
			<em><br>"Were a hundred moons to rise and a thousand suns, the light so created will be but utter darkness without the Guru."</em>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>God, says Guru Nanak, is the creator of all that exists and in His creation He manifested His name. He, the Beneficent One, is the source of mercy and grace (1). They who attach themselves to His Name are the winners in life; the rest remain losers (2). One will find by His grace alone the true Guru who puts him in the path of righteousness and helps him rid himself of his ego</li>
				<li>In the world beyond neither caste nor power will prevail. They alone will receive honour there who are by the Lord favoured. Sweetness and humility are the essence of all virtue. Rejecting the sacred thread of the highborn. Guru Nanak tells the Brahman that he had little use for the ceremonial cord which got soiled and broke. What he would rather have was a cord made of the cotton of compassion, spun into the thread of contentment, twisted with truth and knitted with continence. He who submits to the Lord`s will is approved and is received at the divine portal. Commenting upon the hypocrisy prevalent in contemporary society, he says that Brahmans wear their traditional apparel and apply the saffron mark on their foreheads, yet they eat the grain they receive from those they call unclean.</li>
				<li>Inside their homes they worship their idols, and outside they read books of the Muslims and take to their ways. Those wearing the sacred thread round their neck carry in their hand the butcher`s knife. The woman who has given birth to a child is not impure as the custom decrees. Impurity is the mind which is filled with covetousness, impure is the tongue which utters falsehood, impure are the eyes which look at another`s woman; impure is the ear which listens to slander. The impurity of impurities is to become attached to anyone/anything other than Him. Why call woman evil of whom great men are born? Do not stigmatize anyone as evil. That is the essence of all knowledge. Nor should one argue with a fool (19).</li>

		<li><strong>The message of Asa ki Var:</strong><br>
		The Asa-di-var does not tell a story, its theme is: "How to become a spiritual person"- a devta, "a spiritual being". In it, Guru Nanak also warns us against the rituals and tricks of priests and monks. The most important thing is how to build up one's character and how to remove the obstacles that lay in the path of a disciple, the most important of which is the ego, selfishness or conceit.<br>
Even holy persons, who are outwardly very good and kind, often suffer from religious pride. Sometimes so-called religious people, commit heinous crimes through self-righteousness and bigotry. It should be remembered that Ego in its pure essence is self-awareness or identity which when regulated is an essential, for it is the basis of one's character or moral nature. When regulated by right motivation and active service, it is positive and beneficial. But if uncontrolled through self pride of position or riches, it becomes selfish and mean.<br>
The effects of the Ego are particularly contemptible and disastrous when disguised by the apparent holiness or tradition, which exploits ordinary people's ignorance and credulity. The practice of humility and love are the most effective qualities for keeping people away from sin, far better than all recitations and rituals of religion.<br>
Initially, it is the fear of God's wrath or displeasure which inspires the seeker to offer worship and prayer. Over the years this fear should become gradually replaced by love and self surrender, so that he loses his Impatience with those who are imperfect; he is in sympathy with them, for they are like strayed sheep. Only by self-discipline and serving other people, can one become worthy of divine grace. Associate with holy persons and learn from them, the secrets of spiritual wisdom.

		<li><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
		Asa Ki Var is a collection of 24 pauris or stanzas written by Guru Nanak Devji (Sri Guru Granth Sahib, page 462-475). The founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak Dev ji wrote the first 9 together on one occasion and later wrote 15 more stanzas on a different occasion. These two parts were then compiled together by the 5th Guru, Guru Arjan Dev ji in 1604 AD.<br>
When Guru Arjan Dev ji was assimilating the Holy Granth, he added a few Sloks of Guru Nanak and in some cases Guru Angad Dev ji, the second Guru of the Sikhs. These Sloks are tied together in a way that they relate to the same theme as highlighted in the pauri. In its present form, the Asa Di War contains a few more shabads recited by Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh Guru.<br>
The Asa Di War kirtan is recited in the early morning hours in a very melodious way and style as mentioned by Guru Arjan Dev Ji called "Tunde Asraje Ki Dhuni" after the name of the contemporary brave and pious king Asraj. One of the hands of the king was amputated, so he was called Tunda meaning crippled. The deeds and the ode of this king was sung by the bards in that typical fashion which then was extremely popular and melodious and was therefore adopted to performing Asa Di War.
